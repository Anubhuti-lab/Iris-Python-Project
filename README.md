# Iris-Dataset-Classification Project
Overview
This project explores the classic Iris flower dataset, implementing various machine learning classification techniques to predict the species of iris flowers based on their physical characteristics. The Iris dataset is widely used in pattern recognition literature and is perfect for demonstrating machine learning algorithms for classification tasks.
Dataset Description
The dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with 50 samples from each of three species:

Iris setosa
Iris versicolor
Iris virginica

Each sample has four features measured in centimeters:

Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width

Key Features

Data Exploration & Visualization: Comprehensive analysis of the dataset with informative visualizations to understand feature distributions and relationships
Preprocessing Pipeline: Implementation of data cleaning, feature scaling, and train-test splitting
Multiple Classification Models: Implementation of several algorithms including:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Logistic Regression


Model Evaluation: Detailed performance analysis using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimization of model parameters using grid search and cross-validation

Results
The analysis revealed distinct clustering patterns:

Iris setosa is clearly separable from the other species
Versicolor and virginica show some overlap but are still largely distinguishable
Petal measurements provide stronger discriminating power than sepal measurements

The best performing model achieved 97% accuracy on the test set, with particularly strong performance on the setosa class.
Correlation Analysis
An important part of the analysis was examining correlations between features:
pythoncorr = df.select_dtypes(include="number").corr()
This revealed strong positive correlations between:

Petal length and petal width (r = 0.96)
Petal length and sepal length (r = 0.87)

Future Work

Implement dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA
Build an interactive dashboard for model predictions
Deploy the model as a simple web application
Explore deep learning approaches for comparison
